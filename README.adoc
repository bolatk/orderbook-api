== Overview
This project is organized into multiple packages to maintain a clean and modular structure. The package organization is designed to separate different parts of the application logically, making it easier to develop, maintain, and extend.

== Package Breakdown

=== `com.akaibo.orderbook.api`
- This package contains the **Verticles** that handle the API requests for different features.
- Each Verticle is responsible for the lifecycle of a specific REST API endpoint.

**Classes**:
- `OrderBookApiVerticle.java`: Handles the API requests for retrieving the order book.
- `OrderApiVerticle.java`: Handles the API requests for placing limit orders.
- `TradeHistoryApiVerticle.java`: Handles the API requests for retrieving the trade history.

=== `com.akaibo.orderbook.model`
- This package contains **data model classes**, which represent entities such as orders and trades.
- These classes are **Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs)** that hold the data and are used for passing information around the application.

**Classes**:
- `Order.java`: Represents a limit order with properties like `price`, `quantity`, `side`, and `currencyPair`.
- `Trade.java`: Represents a trade with properties like `price`, `quantity`, `currencyPair`, `tradedAt`, etc.

=== `com.akaibo.orderbook.service`
- This package contains **service classes** that implement the business logic for handling operations related to orders, trades, etc.
- Services are responsible for managing in-memory data structures, business rules, and complex processing.

**Classes**:
- `OrderBookService.java`: Contains methods for adding, updating, and retrieving orders, maintaining the order book's state.
- `TradeHistoryService.java`: Contains methods for adding and retrieving trades for the trade history.

=== `com.akaibo.orderbook.util`
- This package contains utility classes or constants that are used throughout the project.
- **Constants** or helper methods that multiple components need to access are placed here.

**Classes**:
- `Constants.java`: Stores constant values such as predefined status messages, error codes, API paths, etc.

=== `com.akaibo.orderbook.MainVerticle`
- **`MainVerticle`** serves as the entry point for the Vert.x application.
- It is responsible for deploying all other Verticles that make up the system.

== Example Package Usage
- A request comes to the `OrderApiVerticle`.
- The Verticle calls methods from `OrderBookService` to add or remove an order.
- The `OrderBookService` interacts with **in-memory data structures** to manage orders.
- The response is returned to the client, using the **model** objects (`Order`, `Trade`) for serialization.

== Benefits of This Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a distinct purpose, reducing dependencies and making the system easier to maintain.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Adding new features (e.g., more API endpoints, new business rules) becomes easier because of the well-defined boundaries.
- **Testing**: The clear separation into **API**, **service**, and **model** packages makes writing unit tests for each layer easier.

== Summary
This package structure helps maintain a clean and organized codebase, making it easier to manage, understand, and extend as new features are added. Each package plays a specific role:
- **`api`**: Handles API requests and represents the endpoints.
- **`model`**: Represents the data structures.
- **`service`**: Contains business logic and handles core processing.
- **`util`**: Stores utility code that is used across the application.
